Personal life[edit]
Mamnoon Hussain hails from a Mujahir family[10] of shoe traders[11] and was born in Agra, UP during the British rule.[12] He and his family migrated to Karachi in 1949 after the independence of Pakistan in 1947.[13]

After graduating from a local high school, Hussain enrolled in the Karachi University where he studied for the Commerce degree. After graduating from the Karachi University in 1963,[14] he entered in the master's program at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) in Karachi, and gained MBA in 1965.[15][16] Initially supporting and strengthening his father's business, he shifted to his own business in textile.[15] Hussain was once president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry.[17]

Political career[edit]
Hussain began take his interest in national politics in 1968 when he joined the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) led by Nurul Amin. Initially an activist with a missionary and reformative zeal in 1968, Hussain began joint secretary of the Pakistan Muslim League's Karachi chapter.[16] In 1993, he officially joined the PML(N) led by Nawaz Sharif and was appointed the Finance Secretary of the PML(N) in Sindh.[16]

In June 1999, he became the Governor of Sindh, but his term was cut short on 12 October 1999 when the PML(N) government was ousted in a military coup.[16] His credentials as a politician devoted to the cause of democracy were established when he became a political prisoner after raising his voice against military regime of Pervez Musharraf.[16]

Azhar Haroon, current president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: "He had no political affiliation until 1999 but his polite discourse and professional ability impressed Nawaz Sharif, who appointed him as the Governor of Sindh".[18] He is a relatively lesser known figure,[13][19] described as loyal to Nawaz Sharif,[20] and was elected as President of Pakistan as the official nominee of the PML-N in the July 2013 presidential election. Hussain secured 432 votes and his only rival Wajihuddin Ahmed received 77.[21] He was sworn in on 9 September 2013 in a ceremony held at Aiwan-e-Sadr, attended by mainstream political and military leadership alongside foreign dignitaries, media personnel and his close relatives.[22]
