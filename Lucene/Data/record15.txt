Khan has been the subject of several controversies, including certain legal troubles.

Hit-and-run case
On 28 September 2002, Khan was arrested for rash and negligent driving after his car ran into a bakery in Mumbai; one person who was sleeping on the pavement outside the bakery died and three others were injured in the mishap.[162] Charges of culpable homicide were laid against him, but later dropped.[163] On 24 July 2013, he was formally charged with culpable homicide in the case, to which he pleaded not guilty.

On 6 May 2015, Khan was found guilty of all charges in the case. The Bombay Sessions Court concluded that Salman Khan was driving the car under the influence of alcohol causing the death of one and serious injury to four homeless persons. Sessions judge DW Deshpande convicted the actor for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced him to five years in prison. Later on same day, Salman Khan, being represented by Senior Counsel Amit Desai was granted bail by the Bombay High Court till 8 May 2015,[164][165][166] on which the court suspended his prison sentence until the final appeal hearing in July.[167][168][169] His driver Ashok Singh, who had given the testimony that it was him who was driving the car at the time of accident, was charged with perjury for misguiding the Court with false testimony and was arrested.[170] The kidnapping and eventual death of prime witness Police Constable Ravindra Patil remains a mystery, with some suspecting the involvement of organised crime.[171][172][173][174] In December 2015, Khan was acquitted of all charges from this case, due to lack of evidence.[175][176] The Supreme Court on Tuesday July 5, 2016 admitted a plea by the Maharashtra government that challenged the acquittal of Salman Khan in this hit-and-run case by the Bombay High Court. The court refused to fast-track the case.[177]

Relationship with Aishwarya Rai
His relationship with actress Aishwarya Rai was a well publicized topic in the Indian media.[178] After their break-up in March 2002, Rai accused him of harassing her. She claimed that Khan had not been able to come to terms with their break-up and was hounding her; her parents lodged a complaint against him.[179] In 2005, news outlets released what was said to be an illicit copy of a mobile phone call recorded in 2001 by the Mumbai police. It appeared to be a call in which he threatened Rai, in an effort to force her to appear at social events held by Mumbai crime figures. The call featured boasts of connections to organised crime and derogatory comments about other actors. However, the alleged tape was tested in the government's Forensic lab in Chandigarh, which concluded that it was fake.[180][181]

Blackbuck hunting case
On 17 February 2006, Khan was sentenced to one year in prison for hunting the Chinkara, an endangered species. The sentence was stayed by a higher court during appeal.[182] On 10 April 2006, he was handed a five-year jail term and remanded to Jodhpur jail until 13 April when he was granted bail.[183] On 24 July 2012, Rajasthan High Court finalized charges against Salman Khan and his other colleagues in the endangered blackbuck killing case, paving way for start of the trial.[184] On 9 July 2014, Supreme Court issued a notice to Salman on Rajasthan government's plea challenging the HC order suspending his conviction.[185] Salman Khan was acquitted in the blackbuck and chinkara poaching cases by the Rajasthan High Court on Monday 24 July 2016.[186] On 18 October 2016 the Rajasthan Government decided to approach Supreme Court against Salman Khan's acquittal in two cases related to chinkara (black buck) poaching case.[187]

Remarks about 26/11 attacks
On September 2010, Khan was reported to have claimed during an interview to a Pakistani channel that the 26/11 attacks got a lot of attention because the "elite" were targeted.[188][189] During the interview the actor had said: "It was the elite that was targeted this time. Five star hotels and stuff. So they panicked. Then they got up and spoke about it. My question is why not before. Attacks have happened in trains and small towns too, but no one talked about it so much."[188][189] Khan also said that Pakistan was not to be blamed for it, and that the Indian security forces had failed.[190] Khan's comments had drawn strong reactions from Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra Chagan Bhujbal, Shiv Sena, BJP and other political parties.[191] The comments were also condemned by Ujwal Nikam, Special Prosecutor in the 26/11 trial.[191] Khan later apologized for his comments.[188]

Tweets on Yakub Memon
On 25 July 2015, Khan made a number of tweets from his Twitter account in support of the 1993 Bombay bombings accuse Yakub Memon. Memon was scheduled to be executed, before which Khan made his tweets.[192] Khan said that Yakub's brother, Tiger Memon should be hanged instead. He also asked the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif to confirm "whether the mob boss is in his country."[193] The tweets sparked protests outside his house where police had to be deployed, and was criticised in the social media and from his father, Salim Khan. Following these incidents, Khan withdrew his tweets and apologised.[194]

Uri attack
On September 2016, Khan made a statement saying that, "They (Pakistani) are artists not terrorists. It’s the government who gives them permits and visas".[195]
