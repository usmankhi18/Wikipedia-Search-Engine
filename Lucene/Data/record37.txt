History[edit]

The five zones of Islamabad
In 1960, land was transferred from the Rawalpindi District of the Punjab province for the purpose of establishing Pakistan's new capital. According to the 1960 master plan, the ICT included the city of Rawalpindi, and was to be composed of the following parts:[5]

Rawalpindi, 259 square kilometres (100 sq mi)
Islamabad Proper (including the institutional and industrial areas), 220.15 square kilometres (85.00 sq mi)
Islamabad (Margalla Hills) Park, 220.15 square kilometres (85.00 sq mi)
Islamabad Rural Area, 446.20 square kilometres (172.28 sq mi)
However, the city of Rawalpindi was eventually excluded from the ICT on its creation in the 1980s.[5] The remainder of the territory is now subdivided into five zones, with Zone I designated to house all residential, industrial and government institutions.

Punjab is located to the south of the ICT, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is located to the north west.

Islamabad was designed and built to be a modern capital for Pakistan. It was established in 1960, on the orders of then President General Ayub Khan.

Islamabad nestles against the backdrop of the Margalla Hills at the northern end of Potohar Plateau. Its climate is healthy, relatively pollution free, plentiful in water resources and lush green. It is a modern and carefully planned residential city with wide roads and avenues, many public buildings and well-organised bazaars, markets, and shopping centres.

Government[edit]
Islamabad is situated between the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab but Islamabad is not a part of any province. The federal Government of Pakistan controls it and is one of the two federal Territories of Pakistan (the other being FATA) which is directly governed by the Federal Government of Pakistan.

Cityscape[edit]
Civic administration[edit]
See also: Capital Development Authority
The main administrative authority of the city is Islamabad Capital Territory Administration (ICT) with some help from Capital Development Authority (CDA), which oversees the planning, development, construction, and administration of the city.[15] Islamabad Capital Territory is divided into eight zones: Administrative Zone, Commercial District, Educational Sector, Industrial Sector, Diplomatic Enclave, Residential Areas, Rural Areas and Green Area.[16] Islamabad city is divided into five major zones: Zone I, Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV, and Zone V. Out of these, Zone IV is the largest in area All sectors of ghouri town (1,2,3,VIP,5,4-A,4-B,4-C,5-A,5-B and sector 7), located in this zone.[17] Zone I consists mainly of all the developed residential sectors while Zone II consists of the under-developed residential sectors. Each residential sector is identified by a letter of the alphabet and a number, and covers an area of approximately 2 km × 2 km ( 1 1⁄4 mi ×  1 1⁄4 mi). The sectors are lettered from A to I, and each sector is divided into four numbered sub-sectors.[18]

Series A, B, and C are still underdeveloped. The D series has seven sectors (D-11 to D-17),[17] of which only sector D-12 is completely developed. This series is located at the foot of Margalla Hills.[16] The E Sectors are named from E-7 to E-17.[17] Many foreigners and diplomatic personnel are housed in these sectors.[16] In the revised Master Plan of the city, CDA has decided to develop a park on the pattern of Fatima Jinnah Park in sector E-14. Sectors E-8 and E-9 contain the campuses of Bahria University, Air University, and the National Defence University.[19][20][21] The F and G series contains the most developed sectors. F series contains sectors F-5 to F-17; some sectors are still under-developed.[17] F-5 is an important sector for the software industry in Islamabad, as the two software technology parks are located here. The entire F-9 sector is covered with Fatima Jinnah Park. The Centaurus complex will be one of the major landmarks of the F-8 sector.[16] G sectors are numbered G-5 through G-17.[17] Some important places include the Jinnah Convention Center and Serena Hotel in G-5, the Red Mosque in G-6, and the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, the largest medical complex in the capital, located in G-8.[16]

The H sectors are numbered H-8 through H-17.[17] The H sectors are mostly dedicated to educational and health institutions. National University of Sciences and Technology covers a major portion of sector H-12.[16] The I sectors are numbered from I-8 to I-18. With the exception of I-8, which is a well-developed residential area, these sectors are primarily part of the industrial zone. Currently two sub-sectors of I-9 and one sub-sector of I-10 are used as industrial areas. CDA is planning to set up Islamabad Railway Station in Sector I-18 and Industrial City in sector I-17.[16] Zone III consists primarily of the Margalla Hills and Margalla Hills National Park. Rawal Lake is in this zone. Zone IV and V consist of Islamabad Park, and rural areas of the city. The Soan River flows into the city through Zone V.[17]

Islamabad/Rawalpindi Metropolitan Area[edit]
See also: List of places in Islamabad
When the master plan for Islamabad was drawn up in 1960, Islamabad and Rawalpindi, along with the adjoining areas, was to be integrated to form a large metropolitan area called Islamabad/Rawalpindi Metropolitan Area. The area would consist of the developing Islamabad, the old colonial cantonment city of Rawalpindi, and Margalla Hills National Park, including surrounding rural areas.[24][25] However, Islamabad city is part of the Islamabad Capital Territory, while Rawalpindi is part of Rawalpindi District, which is part of province of Punjab .[26]

Initially, it was proposed that the three areas would be connected by four major highways: Murree Highway, Islamabad Highway, Soan Highway, and Capital Highway. However, to date only two highways have been constructed: Kashmir Highway (the former Murree Highway) and Islamabad Highway.[25] Plans of constructing Margalla Avenue are also underway.[27] Islamabad is the hub all the governmental activities while Rawalpindi is the centre of all industrial, commercial, and military activities. The two cities are considered sister cities and are highly interdependent.[24]

Islamabad has seen an expansion in information and communications technology with the addition two Software Technology Parks, which house numerous national and foreign technological and information technology companies. The tech parks are located in Evacuee Trust Complex and Awami Markaz. Awami Markaz houses 36 IT companies while Evacuee Trust house 29 companies.[32] Call centres for foreign companies have been targeted as another significant area of growth, with the government making efforts to reduce taxes by as much as 10% to encourage foreign investments in the information technology sector. Most of Pakistan's state-owned companies like PIA, PTV, PTCL, OGDCL, and Zarai Taraqiati Bank Ltd. are based in Islamabad. Headquarters of all major telecommunication operators such as PTCL, Mobilink, Telenor, Ufone, and China Mobile are located in Islamabad.
